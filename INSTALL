Dependencies
============
This package requires Rakitzis' variant of the rc shell.

On debian-based distributions you can install it by running:

  apt-get install rc

Similar method should work for almost any GNU/Linux distribution and other
decent operating systems, like *BSD.

If you want to run it under an original-flavour rc, you just have to replace
'else' with 'if not'. That's it.


Installation
============
First you need to "build" it. You can do so with the following commands:

  ./configure && make

Once built, it can be installed by running the following as root:

  make install

From now on it should start once the user logins.

Of course the 'configure' script supports a lot of options, just run it with
the --help parameter to see what it can do for you.
